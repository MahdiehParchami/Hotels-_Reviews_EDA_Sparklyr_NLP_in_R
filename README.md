# Hotels-Reviews_EDA_Sparklyr_NLP_in_R
Implementing EDA, using Sparklyr library and NLP technique in R

I use a big data set containing 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of  1493 luxury hotels across Europe. I use Python for Data Exploratory Analysis and Data preprocessing, sparklyr for my analysis, and Tableau for creating 
my dashboards and telling the story. Moreover, I perform NLP data mining techniques in this dataset to find insights. 

Among the top 5 five countries with the best hotels, Farance’s Ritz Paris ranked the best in Europe with a ranking of 9.73. A review analysis of the review score, scored by all the hotels in 
Europe also displayed that Farance’s Ritz Paris had the most reviews and these reviews could either be positive reviews or negative reviews. Reviews were made monthly with the 8th month 
(August) having the greatest number of reviews. However, the case hotels in good locations had positive reviews from lodgers, and hotels with small rooms, in poor locations had negative 
reviews from hotel lodgers. 
Lodgers on business trips usually book double rooms during their trips. Similarly, they left positive reviews based on either the location and staff service they received and negative reviews 
based on the nature of the rooms and breakfast service they received. 
Finally, we looked at the types of lodgers and found out that couples were the most to book hotels in Europe. The positive reviews left by them were also attributed to the location, good 
rooms, and staff service they received during their stay.
